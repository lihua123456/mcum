%    Input, integer CYCLE_NUM, the number of 10-second time cycles to model.
%
%  Local Parameters:
%
%    Local, integer CARS, the number of cars waiting at the light.
%
%    Local, integer CARS_IN, the total number of cars that have come.
%

%
%    Local, integer CYCLE, the number of time cycles that have elapsed.
%
%    Local, integer CYCLE_LENGTH, the number of seconds in one time cycle.
%
%    Local, integer GREEN_CYCLES, the number of 10-second time cycles that 
%    a green light lasts.
%
%    Local, integer GREEN_TIMER, keeps track of the number of time cycles the
%    green light has been on.
%
%    Local, integer LIGHT, the state of the light.
%    'r', the light is now red.
%    'g', the light is now green.
%
%    Local, real P, the probability that a new car will come to the light
